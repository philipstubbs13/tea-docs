# TeaDocs

In a world where there's so much info but so little time, I wanted to create a space that filters the noise
and shows you what I have been up to.

This project is built using [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/), which is a tool used
for creating documentation websites. Starlight is powered by Astro. For more information about Astro,
see the [Astro docs](https://astro.build/).

If you would like to contribute to this project or are just curious and would like to run this project locally, all you have to do is run `npm run dev` from the `spill-the-tea` directory. This will start up the development server and let you preview your changes locally.
